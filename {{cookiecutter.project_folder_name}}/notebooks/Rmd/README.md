## TAKEN AND MODIFIED FROM ERIN'S SZ_PINT.

#note: you must create a file called  \_bookdown.yml containing a description of what to knit into the bookdown. Here is an example:

book_filename: "SSD_PINT_full"
language:
  ui:
    chapter_name: "Chapter "
delete_merged_file: true
new_session: yes
rmd_files: [
  "index.Rmd",
  "01a_mangle_participant_dems.Rmd",
  "01b_mangle_scanQA_covars.Rmd",
  "02a_pint_displacement_stats.Rmd",
  "02b_MDS_stats.Rmd",
  "02c_seedcorr_area_stats.Rmd",
  "03_subcortical_cortical_stats_hemi.Rmd",
  "04_cortical-cortical_changes.Rmd",
 # "05_sulcal_depth_stats.Rmd",
  "06_whole_matrix_stats.Rmd"
]
output_dir: "../reports"


# These notebooks contain a workflow for {{cookiecutter.project_name}}.

These are collected into an bookdown book.

To render the book:

```sh
module load R/3.5.0 rstudio

```

## make sure the current working directory is set to {{cookiecutter.folder_name}}/notebooks/Rmd
This part of the script will remove any existing reports and overwrite them with new bookdown.


```sh
rm -rf ../../reports/Rmd_rendered/*
rm SSD_PINT_full.*
rm 0*.md
```

```{r}
bookdown::render_book('index.Rmd', output_format = "bookdown::gitbook", output_dir = '../../reports/Rmd_rendered')
bookdown::render_book('index.Rmd', output_format = "bookdown::pdf_book", output_dir = '../../reports/Rmd_rendered')
```
