TIGRLab Analysis Cookie-Cutter
==================================

For use in tigrlab projects. 


install or module load cookiecutter, then type in `cookiecutter https://github.com/TIGRLab/TIGRLab_cookiecutter.git` to get started.


Cookiecutter is a way to create the directory structure and even some automatic documentation for a project. We created this to help structure our projects in a consistent, reproducible manner that other lab members can interpret easily.

If you are setting up an analysis project in the lab (or remoting in), you can `module load cookiecutter`. Then, simply navigate to your scratch/ or projects/ and type in `cookiecutter $tigrlab_default_template` to get started.

Alternatively, you can also install cookiecutter at home and use cookiecutter based on the github repo. `cookiecutter https://github.com/TIGRLab/TIGRLab_cookiecutter.git`.

After setup, please take a look at the README file for instructions on how to initialize your project in a git repo. 

Here are instructions for installing cookiecutter: https://cookiecutter.readthedocs.io/en/1.7.0/installation.html#install-cookiecutter


All the best,
